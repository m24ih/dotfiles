# If you want to try hardware cursors,
# you can enable them by setting `cursor:no_hardware_cursors = false` ,
# but it will require also enabling `cursor:allow_dumb_copy`
# which may cause small to major hitches whenever the cursor shape changes.
# If this is a problem on your system, keep hardware cursors disabled.

# This may solve specific issues in Electron apps.
